<h3><i>“I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.” </i>- <i>Walden </i>(1854)</h3>
<br>
<h4>A brief timeline of his life:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1817 Born on July 12 in Concord, Massachusetts</li>
  <li>1837 Meets Ralph Waldo Emerson after Emerson's "The American Scholar" lecture, setting him on the path of the Transcendentalists</li>
  <li>1845 Begins his two-year stay at Walden Pond</li>
  <li>1848 Spends the night in jail for refusing to pay the poll tax, protesting slavery and the war with Mexico</li>
  <li>1849 Publishes essay "Civil Disobedience"</li>
  <li>1849 Publishes <i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>, which fails to sell</li>
  <li>1854 Publishes <i>Walden</i>, which is well-received</li>
  <li>1862 Dies on May 6 after a long battle with tuberculosis</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Many people pronounce his last name with the accent on the second syllable (ther-O), perhaps because of the triphthong "eau", but the proper pronunciation is like that of the word "thorough" (THER-o or THOR-o). Good luck fighting that battle, though!</p>
<p>The late Ken Kifer, professor and avid cyclist, wrote an extensive analysis of <i>Walden</i>. You can find it <a href="http://www.phred.org/~alex/kenkifer/www.kenkifer.com/Thoreau/index.htm" target="blank">here</a>.<p>
<p>Thoreau's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau" target="blank">Wikipedia page </a>is a good start if you are looking for more information about his life. However, the best way to get to know Thoreau is to <i>read</i> him! You can find all of his writing, including books, essays, poetry, and correspondence, at <a href="http://www.thoreau-online.org" target="blank">thoreau-online.org</a>.</p>
